# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter UFO sightings by the following criteria:
1) Date
2) City
3) State
4) Country
5) Shape 

## Results
Our webpage has a 'Filter Search' function on the left where we are able to filter UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, and shape:

We are able to narrow down our search results by typing in multiple types of criteria. For example, when we filter our search for sightings in El Cajon, we are left with five UFO sightings:

When we filter our search results for sightings in El Cajon with a triangle shape, our results are narrowed down further, leaving us with two UFO sightings:

To begin a new search, simply clear all of the filter search fields.
## Summary
* One drawback of this design is that the Filter Search fields are only initiated by clicking 'enter' on the keyboard. For example, if I type in El Cajon in the 'Enter a City' field, I must also click enter for UFO sightings in El Cajon to appear. This is also the case when clearing the search. If I search for UFO sightings in El Cajon and click 'enter', these sightings appear, but to clear the search, I must not only delete El Cajon from the 'Enter a City' field, but I must also click enter. 
* For further development, I reccomend adding both a 'Search' and a 'Clear Search' button. With these two buttons, it will be clear to the user when their filtered search has been generated as well as when it has been cleared.
